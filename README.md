# navclipbrd
Dynamics Nav Clipboard Manager

The program allows you to save copied C\AL functions, variables, fields from the page/table designer/etc., objects from the Development Environment, data from tables and everything that can be copied and pasted from/to Nav to a file.
It also works in older versions (Nav 2009) in the object designer. You can save form controls, buttons, etc. to a file. for further reuse.
Once you save the clipboard data to a file, you can load back from the file in the future and insert functions, variables, etc. back to Nav.

The program also allows you to convert Nav clipboard data into BASE64 format on the fly for text sharing.
