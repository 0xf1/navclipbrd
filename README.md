# navclipbrd
Dynamics Nav Clipboard Manager

This program allows you to save copied C\AL functions, variables, objects from the Development Environment, and data from tables to a file.
Once you save the clipboard data to a file, you can load back from the file in the future and insert functions, variables, etc. back to Nav.

The program also allows you to convert Nav clipboard data into BASE64 format on the fly for text sharing.
